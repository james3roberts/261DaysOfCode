Read me file for my coding every work day for 1 year. 
02/01/2022
Day 1.
Well tonight I made a hello world test in java to make sure everything was working correctly. 
I used gedit to open a new file. wrote the test code. Then I saved it as a .java file.
next I used the javac "filename" to collect everything but i do not know if this is needed. I will come back to this.
I made a hello world test in c++. once again made the file and saved it as a .cc then I compiled it using g++ HelloWorld.cc then I created an executable file using g++ -o Helloworld Helloworld.cc after that to run it I just used the ./HelloWorld seem to work.
Last for tonight I will push everyting to GitHub and start on my homework. I will use the git add git commit and git push to do this. I hope it works. 

Day 2. 
today will be very short unless I find time to come back later. I made a new hello world python test file and ran it from the comand line. I Like how I can just tell the computer what to do instead of having to use the mouse. 

Day3.
I spent most of the day writting test code in java. I need to figure out why my 2nd branches are not being checked. But that is not the point of this repo. So to change things up I am going to start on a web scraper. Hopefully I will I can use it to find internships to apply to. I am also on a mission to learn the command line on ubuntu. So I have already downloaded beautiful soup. I know I will be using this. Well I started in the text editor but I am going to switch to vsc. So I may be done for tonight.
