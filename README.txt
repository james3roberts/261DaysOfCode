Day 1.
Well tonight I made a hello world test in java to make sure everything was working correctly. 
I used gedit to open a new file. wrote the test code. Then I saved it as a .java file.
next I used the javac "filename" to collect everything but i do not know if this is needed. I will come back to this.
I made a hello world test in c++. once again made the file and saved it as a .cc then I compiled it using g++ HelloWorld.cc then I created an executable file using g++ -o Helloworld Helloworld.cc after that to run it I just used the ./HelloWorld seem to work.
Last for tonight I will push everyting to GitHub and start on my homework. I will use the git add git commit and git push to do this. I hope it works.
