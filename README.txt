Read me file for my coding every work day for 1 year. 
The first project that I will work on is a web scraper. I am hoping that I will be able to find a way to scrape job boards and create a daily list of 
jobs to apply to. I will be using python for this. currently it scrapes software developer internships within 25 miles of colorado springs.
